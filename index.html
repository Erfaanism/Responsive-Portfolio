						<p>Hi, my name is Ali and I am a soon to be Web Developer. Technology is, has always been and will be my passion. Please visit my portfolio later to see some the projects that I have worked. I want to thank my instructor and future classmates in advance for all I'm learning from them.</p>
						<p>This course is very challenging for all of us, please read the below qoutes from Matrix, I think it helps:</p>
						<p><br>&#128073; Sometimes everything hangs by a single decision: red pill or blue pill. But often that critical choice isn't always so obvious. It could come at any time. It could be right now.</p>
						<p><br>&#128273; This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back. You take the blue pill - the story ends, you wake up in your bed and believe whatever you want to believe. You take the red pill - you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes</p>
						<p><br>&#128170; Even a hero can get scared, drop his phones off the side of a building and give up. He just doesn't let it end that way.</p>
						<p><br>&#128170; What are you waiting for? You're faster than this. Don't think you are... know you are. Come on! Stop trying to hit me and hit me!</p>
